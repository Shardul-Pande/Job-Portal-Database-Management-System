# Job-Portal-Database-Management-System


OBJECTIVE : 
As an international graduate, every student focuses on getting an internship/job through websites like LinkedIn, and Glassdoor. We aim to make a centralized database that contains job postings from multiple websites, making it easier for students to hunt for
internships/jobs.

Job seekers could find jobs based on their preferred location, type
(remote or onsite), and types of companies (MNCs, Startups, etc.)
